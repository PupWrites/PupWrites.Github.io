# My Journey
## The Pain That Follows

When I close my eyes, I see them. The people I blame my self for losing, every mistake I have ever made. every moment that has altered my life for the worst. ever decision that led to my hunger pain and hurt. "I chose this" whisper or yell, "It's Your Fault" I would convince my self, Not being able to get up from the shower floor, as I shake, feeling cold when the water was warm. heart pounding faster and faster its hammering echoing through my brain, as if someone was laughing over me yanking on my veins,
	
my eyes unable to stay open out of fear from what I might see, so I choose to close them, forgetting the enemy in my mind. the demons that slipped in years ago, Shouting, Creating images to cloud my belief that I am fine. it could end so easily, day in day out the thought of simply chambering the round turned to reality, it could end so easily.

5lbs of pressure was all it took. but ever time the barrel touches my temple my scream swallows me with fear. This is my Pain. The pain that Follows

### 1st Poem 


#### Time

> I am burned by the coldest fires
> and lost in the brightest of caves
>
> I am Torn by soft words that make me feel brave
>
> I am **Time** and though I never stop
>		I cannot  **Turn Back**
>
> Fear
>
> Pain
>
> Death
>
> all which I wish I could change, Slowly slice deeper between each vein 
why can't I turn back the hurt or the sorry, 
always wishing for a better tomorrow
>
> I can scream, yank, or even pull the hand till blood drip...drip...drips...
even turn it forward to skip some pain
but just like fears, 
>		The past stays the same
>
> I am **Time** And though I can never **change** my **past**. 
> I tick **forward** all the same
>
